# libft
A bunch of cool functions. Some are redesigned from classic libc functions, while others were created to perform common tasks. Part of the 42 School curriculum. Enjoy :)

# Compilation
This project requires `gcc` to compile the static library. To compile it, run `make` and wait a couple of seconds. If you like it, it's possible to run some tests with the command `make test`.
